The aim of this project is to learn a model that can map a musial melodic sequence to to harmonic sequence. More specifically this model takes a temporal, monophonic sequence of notes and predicts the corresponding sequence of chords. These chords correspond to the harmonic accompaniment intended by the composer to be played along with the piece.

The primary assumption of this project is that it is useful to treat the melody as an observed sequence generated by the underlying chord sequence. In this sense we have a noisey channel model, similar to a natual language processing problem, where the note sequence can be likened to a sequence of words in a sentence and the chord sequence corresponds to the underlying meaning represented in these notes.

To this we can add the markov assumption. Specifically that the notes generated by a chord a time $t_i$ are conditionally independant of the notes generated by chords at all other times $t_j, i \neq j$, given the chord at $t_i$.

From this a decision must be made
